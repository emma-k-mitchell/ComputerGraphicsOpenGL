# How do I approach designing software?
#1. What new skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This was my first experience working with OpenGL, so almost all the work I did on this project was a "new skill". I would say the biggest thing I have taken from this class is an understanding of how 3D objects are rendered, textured, and shaded. 
#2. What design process did you follow for your project work?
Work on the project was done in a series of 7 milestone assignments, each consisting of 7 possible days of work. The project was added to each week, resulting in the 3D scene included here.
#3. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The process of starting with somthing simple, and gradually adding to it can be applied in many other areas of my education/work. I have learned, from this class, the benefit of starting work on projects early so that I have plenty of time to reach out for help as needed.

# How do I approach developing programs?
#1. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
More than any other projects I have worked on to date, this project relied heavily on trial and error. OpenGL prooved to be quite dificult and there were many times when I figured out "fixes" purely by trying different things until I got a result that was closer to the expected result. What I have taken from this is the ability to not be overwhelmed when code doesnt perform as expected. With time, trial and error, and help from others I can figure out solutions to the issues present in my code.
#2. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projects completion?
There were many milestones that had a significant increase in difficulty from the previous week. This is to be expected, but the way in which I worked had to change as I progressed through the course to accomidate with the harder assignments.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#1. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knwledge and skills that can be applied to your future educational pathway?
After finishing this class, I can say that I enjoyed it. I have always been interested in 3D graphics, and I got alot of hands on experience with this from the class. I will take what I learned, and continue working with OpenGL and Blender. I am interested in game development and working with VR.
